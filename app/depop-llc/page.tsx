        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            An LLC isn't mandatory, but it gives sellers major advantages:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Most sellers operate as sole proprietors by default. That means:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>Business and personal finances are mixed</li>
            <li>You file taxes under your own name and SSN</li>
            <li>There's no liability protection</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            By contrast, an LLC:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>Creates a clear legal structure</li>
            <li>Keeps finances separate</li>
            <li>Simplifies scaling when Depop becomes a real income stream</li>
