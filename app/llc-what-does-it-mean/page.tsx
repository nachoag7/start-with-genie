        <section className="py-12 px-4 bg-gray-50">
          <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">What Is an LLC?</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is a legal business structure that blends the flexibility of a sole proprietorship or partnership with the liability protection of a corporation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Here’s what that means in plain terms:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
              <li><strong>Limited Liability</strong>: Your personal assets (like your home or savings) are protected if your business is sued or goes into debt.</li>
              <li><strong>Tax Flexibility</strong>: LLCs can be taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or even an S corp—giving you options to minimize your tax burden.</li>
              <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Unlike corporations, LLCs are easier to form, require less paperwork, and have fewer ongoing requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
              <p className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">
                <strong>In short</strong>: You get the benefits of a big business structure without the red tape.

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. <strong>Personal Liability Protection</strong></h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">The #1 reason many choose an LLC is asset protection. If your business faces a lawsuit or owes money, your personal belongings are typically safe. This creates a vital boundary between <em>you</em> and <em>your business</em>.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. <strong>Pass-Through Taxation</strong></h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Unlike corporations, LLCs don’t pay federal taxes at the business level. Profits and losses pass through to the owner’s personal tax return—avoiding double taxation.</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">You can even elect to be taxed as an <strong>S Corporation</strong> to save on self-employment taxes. It’s flexible, and you choose what works best.</p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. <strong>Professional Credibility</strong></h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">Operating as an LLC shows customers, clients, and investors that you’re serious. It signals legitimacy and often helps with getting contracts, funding, or higher-value clients.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. <strong>Flexible Ownership &amp; Management</strong></h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">You can form an LLC alone (single-member) or with others (multi-member). You can also decide whether you want to manage it yourself or appoint managers.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. <strong>Easy to Maintain</strong></h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">No board of directors. No shareholders. No annual meetings. LLCs keep things lean so you can focus on growing your business.</p>
