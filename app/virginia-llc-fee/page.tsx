            How Much Does an LLC Cost in Virginia? A Simple 2025 Guide
          </h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-neutral-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            So, you're ready to launch your business in the beautiful Commonwealth of Virginia. That's fantastic! Creating a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is one of the best ways to protect your personal assets. But first, let's answer the big question: "What's the actual fee to get this done?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-neutral-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            Let's cut through the legal jargon and get straight to the numbers. Here's a clear breakdown of the Virginia LLC fees you can expect.
          </p>
        </section>



        {/* Content */}
        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none space-y-12">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">The Main Event: Mandatory Virginia State Fees</h2>
          <p>
            These are the costs you can't avoid. They are paid directly to the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">1. Articles of Organization Filing Fee: $100</h3>
          <p>
            This is the one-time fee to officially create your LLC. To do this, you must file a document called the Articles of Organization, which acts as your business's birth certificate.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fee:</strong> <strong>$100</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Paid once to the Virginia SCC when you first form your LLC.</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Filing online through the SCC Clerk's Information System (CIS) is the fastest and most efficient method. You can have your LLC approved in just a day or two.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once the state processes this filing and your payment, your LLC is officially open for business!
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. Annual Registration Fee: $50</h3>
          <p>
            This isn't a one-and-done deal. To keep your LLC active and in good standing, you must pay an Annual Registration fee every single year.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fee:</strong> <strong>$50</strong></li>
            <li><strong>When It's Due:</strong> Every year by the last day of your LLC's "anniversary month" (the month it was created).</li>
            <li><strong>Heads Up!</strong> Don't forget this! If you're late, the state will hit you with a <strong>$25 late penalty</strong>. If you neglect it for too long, the SCC can administratively cancel your LLC. Set a calendar reminder now!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So, for your first year, you're looking at a minimum cost of <strong>$100</strong>. For every year after that, it's <strong>$50</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Potential & Optional LLC Costs in Virginia</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond the mandatory fees, you might encounter other expenses. These aren't required for everyone, but they are very common.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Registered Agent Service: $0 - $150+ per year</h3>
          <p>
            Virginia law requires every LLC to have a <strong>registered agent</strong>. This is a designated person or company that agrees to receive official legal documents and state notices for your business.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Option 1: Be Your Own Agent ($0):</strong> If you're a Virginia resident with a physical street address (no P.O. Boxes), you can serve as your own agent. It's free, but your address becomes public record, and you must be available during all business hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Option 2: Hire a Commercial Registered Agent ($100 - $150/year):</strong> Many entrepreneurs choose this option for privacy and peace of mind. A professional service handles all your legal mail, ensuring you never miss a critical notice.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Fictitious Name (DBA) Certificate: $10</h3>
          <p>
            If you plan to operate your business under a cool brand name that's different from your formal LLC name (e.g., your LLC is "Tidewater Solutions LLC," but you run "Virginia Beach Web Design"), you need to file for a Fictitious Name, also known as a DBA.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fee:</strong> <strong>$10</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Process:</strong> This is a simple one-time filing with the Virginia SCC.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Other Potential Expenses to Consider:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>LLC Formation Services:</strong> Don't want to deal with the paperwork yourself? You can hire a service to file everything for you. While big names like ZenBusiness and Bizee offer comprehensive packages, a more direct service like <strong>Genie LLC</strong> is great if you just want a fast, simple filing without confusing upsells.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Licenses and Permits:</strong> Depending on your industry and your specific city or county in Virginia, you may need local business licenses to operate. Costs for these vary widely.</li>
            <li><strong>Certified Copies:</strong> If you need an official, certified copy of your formation documents (for opening a bank account, for example), the state charges <strong>$6</strong> per document.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Virginia LLC Fee: The Bottom Line</h2>
