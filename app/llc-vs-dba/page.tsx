              You've got a brilliant business idea and the perfect name for it. But as you start to make things official, you run into a wall of confusing acronyms. The biggest offenders? LLC and DBA.

            <p className="text-lg text-neutral-600 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
              They sound similar, but they are fundamentally different. One protects your personal assets, and the other is just a registered nickname for your business. So, which one is right for you?

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">What is a DBA? (Think of it as a Nickname)</h2>
            <p>
              A DBA, which stands for "Doing Business As," is also known as a trade name or fictitious name. It's simply a registered name that you use to operate your business under that is different from your legal name.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>That's it. A DBA is just a name.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it IS:</strong> A public-facing brand name that allows you, a sole proprietor, to operate under a business name. It also lets an existing LLC or corporation operate a second brand without forming a whole new company.</li>
              <li><strong>What it IS NOT:</strong> A DBA is NOT a business structure. It offers ZERO liability protection. It does not create a separate legal entity. Your business and you are still one and the same in the eyes of the law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Who is a DBA for?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sole Proprietors/Freelancers:</strong> A web designer named Jane Doe wants to do business as "Creative Digital Designs." She files a DBA to legally use that name and open a business bank account.</li>
              <li><strong>Existing LLCs:</strong> "Atlanta Restaurant Group LLC" wants to open a new pizza place called "Peachtree Pies." They can file a DBA for "Peachtree Pies" instead of forming a whole new LLC.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">What is an LLC? (Think of it as a Suit of Armor)</h2>
            <p>
              An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is a formal business structure registered with the state. It creates a completely separate legal entity from you, the owner.
            </p>
            <p>
              This separation is the key. It builds a legal wall between your business's finances and debts and your personal assets (like your house, car, and savings). This is called liability protection.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it IS:</strong> A legal business entity that separates you from your business.</li>
              <li><strong>What it DOES:</strong> It protects your personal assets from business lawsuits and debts. If the business gets sued, your personal finances are generally safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Who is an LLC for?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Serious Entrepreneurs:</strong> Anyone starting a business that will interact with the public, take on debt, or hire employees should strongly consider an LLC.</li>
              <li><strong>Growing Businesses:</strong> If your side hustle is turning into a real-deal business, forming an LLC is the logical next step to protect what you're building.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Can You Have Both? Yes!</h2>
            <p>
              This is a very common and smart strategy. You can form an LLC to get the liability protection and then file a DBA if you want to operate under a different name.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> You form "Blue Ridge Holdings LLC" to protect your personal assets. Then you file a DBA to open a coffee shop called "Mountain Morning Coffee."
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>LLC:</strong> Your suit of armor.</li>
              <li><strong>DBA:</strong> The cool logo on the front of it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">The Bottom Line: Which One Do You Need?</h2>
            <p>
              Let's make it super simple.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Choose a DBA if:</strong> You are a freelancer or sole proprietor just starting out, you understand the risks, and you simply need a professional business name to put on your invoices and bank account.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose an LLC if:</strong> You want to protect your personal assets, you plan to grow, you might hire employees, or you want to be seen as a more formal, established business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>For 99% of new businesses, the liability protection an LLC offers is invaluable.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've decided an LLC is the right move, you don't have to navigate the state paperwork alone. Services can handle the filing for you. While some offer complex packages, a service like Genie LLC is great for a direct, no-fuss approach, focusing purely on getting your LLC filed simply and quickly.
