            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">What is a DBA? (Think of it as a Nickname)</h2>
            <p>
              A DBA, which stands for "Doing Business As," is also known as a trade name or fictitious name. It's simply a registered name that you use to operate your business under that is different from your legal name.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>That's it. A DBA is just a name.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it IS:</strong> A public-facing brand name that allows you, a sole proprietor, to operate under a business name. It also lets an existing LLC or corporation operate a second brand without forming a whole new company.</li>
              <li><strong>What it IS NOT:</strong> A DBA is NOT a business structure. It offers ZERO liability protection. It does not create a separate legal entity. Your business and you are still one and the same in the eyes of the law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Who is a DBA for?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sole Proprietors/Freelancers:</strong> A web designer named Jane Doe wants to do business as "Creative Digital Designs." She files a DBA to legally use that name and open a business bank account.</li>
              <li><strong>Existing LLCs:</strong> "Atlanta Restaurant Group LLC" wants to open a new pizza place called "Peachtree Pies." They can file a DBA for "Peachtree Pies" instead of forming a whole new LLC.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">What is an LLC? (Think of it as a Suit of Armor)</h2>
            <p>
              An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is a formal business structure registered with the state. It creates a completely separate legal entity from you, the owner.
            </p>
            <p>
              This separation is the key. It builds a legal wall between your business's finances and debts and your personal assets (like your house, car, and savings). This is called liability protection.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it IS:</strong> A legal business entity that separates you from your business.</li>
              <li><strong>What it DOES:</strong> It protects your personal assets from business lawsuits and debts. If the business gets sued, your personal finances are generally safe.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Who is an LLC for?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Serious Entrepreneurs:</strong> Anyone starting a business that will interact with the public, take on debt, or hire employees should strongly consider an LLC.</li>
              <li><strong>Growing Businesses:</strong> If your side hustle is turning into a real-deal business, forming an LLC is the logical next step to protect what you're building.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Can You Have Both? Yes!</h2>
            <p>
              This is a very common and smart strategy. You can form an LLC to get the liability protection and then file a DBA if you want to operate under a different name.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> You form "Blue Ridge Holdings LLC" to protect your personal assets. Then you file a DBA to open a coffee shop called "Mountain Morning Coffee."
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>LLC:</strong> Your suit of armor.</li>
              <li><strong>DBA:</strong> The cool logo on the front of it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">The Bottom Line: Which One Do You Need?</h2>
            <p>
              Let's make it super simple.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Choose a DBA if:</strong> You are a freelancer or sole proprietor just starting out, you understand the risks, and you simply need a professional business name to put on your invoices and bank account.</li>
              <li><strong>Choose an LLC if:</strong> You want to protect your personal assets, you plan to grow, you might hire employees, or you want to be seen as a more formal, established business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>For 99% of new businesses, the liability protection an LLC offers is invaluable.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've decided an LLC is the right move, you don't have to navigate the state paperwork alone. Services can handle the filing for you. While some offer complex packages, a service like Genie LLC is great for a direct, no-fuss approach, focusing purely on getting your LLC filed simply and quickly.

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">What's the difference between DBA and LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  A DBA (Doing Business As) is just a registered business name that allows you to operate under a different name than your legal name. It offers no liability protection. An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a formal business structure that creates a separate legal entity and protects your personal assets from business debts and lawsuits.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Which is better: DBA or LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  For most businesses, an LLC is better because it provides liability protection. A DBA is only a name and offers no legal protection. If you're serious about your business and want to protect your personal assets, choose an LLC. Only choose a DBA if you're a sole proprietor just starting out and understand the risks.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Can I have both a DBA and LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  Yes! This is actually a smart strategy. You can form an LLC for liability protection and then file a DBA to operate under a different brand name. For example, you could have "Smith Holdings LLC" as your legal entity and "Mountain Coffee Shop" as your DBA.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">How much does it cost to file a DBA vs LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  DBA filing costs vary by state but typically range from $10-$100. LLC filing costs are higher, usually $50-$500 depending on your state. However, the protection an LLC provides is worth the extra cost for most businesses.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">Do I need a DBA if I have an LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  Only if you want to operate under a different name than your LLC name. If your LLC is "ABC Enterprises LLC" and you want to do business as "Cool Coffee Shop," you'd need a DBA. If you're happy with your LLC name, no DBA is needed.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">What's the main difference in liability protection?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  With a DBA, you and your business are legally the same. If your business gets sued, your personal assets (house, car, savings) are at risk. With an LLC, there's a legal separation. If the LLC gets sued, your personal assets are generally protected.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">How do taxes differ between DBA and LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  With a DBA, you're taxed as a sole proprietor - all business income goes on your personal tax return. With an LLC, you have more flexibility. You can be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, or corporation, depending on your situation and preferences.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-3">When should I upgrade from DBA to LLC?</h3>
                <p className="text-neutral-600">
                  Consider upgrading to an LLC when: you start making significant income, you hire employees, you take on business debt, you want to protect personal assets, or you plan to grow your business. The liability protection becomes more important as your business grows.
