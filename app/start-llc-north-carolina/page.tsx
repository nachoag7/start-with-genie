            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 1: Naming Your North Carolina LLC</h2>
            <p>
              This is a legal requirement, not just a branding exercise. Get it right the first time.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">North Carolina's Naming Rules</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>It MUST contain an LLC suffix:</strong> Your name must end with "Limited Liability Company," "L.L.C.," or the most common, "LLC."</li>
              <li><strong>It MUST be unique:</strong> Your chosen name must be recognizably different from any other business name on record with the North Carolina Secretary of State.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">How to Perform an NC Business Name Search</h3>
            <p>
              Don't assume your name is available. Verify it in 60 seconds.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the North Carolina Secretary of State's <strong>Business Registration Search</strong> tool.</li>
              <li>Select "Company" from the dropdown menu.</li>
              <li>Enter your desired LLC name in the search box.</li>
              <li>If the search results show "No records found," your name is likely available. If you see a list of businesses with the same or a similar name, you need to go back to the drawing board.</li>
            </ol>

            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 my-10">
              <p className="mb-0"><strong>Pro Tip: Secure Your Digital Brand NOW.</strong> Before you even think about filing, check if the matching domain name (<code>yourwebsite.com</code>) and all key social media handles (<code>@yourbusiness</code>) are available. Your legal name should align with your online identity. Secure these assets <em>before</em> you file with the state.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 2: Choosing Your North Carolina Registered Agent</h2>
            <p>
              Every LLC in North Carolina is legally required to appoint and maintain a Registered Agent. This is not optional.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">What is a Registered Agent and Why is it Mandatory?</h3>
            <p>
              A Registered Agent is a person or company responsible for receiving official legal notices and state correspondence (like lawsuit papers or tax notices) for your LLC. They must have a physical street address in North Carolina (a P.O. Box is not acceptable) and be available during all standard business hours.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 3: File Your North Carolina Articles of Organization</h2>
            <p>
              This is the official document that legally creates your LLC. Filing it online with the NC Secretary of State is the fastest and most efficient method.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Information You Need BEFORE You File</h3>
            <p>
              Have this information ready to go to make the online filing process quick and error-free:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your official, verified LLC Name.</li>
              <li>The name and physical North Carolina street address of your Registered Agent.</li>
              <li>The names and addresses of the LLC's members/organizers.</li>
              <li>Your LLC's principal office street and mailing address.</li>
              <li>A valid email address and phone number for the business.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Filing on the NC Secretary of State Portal</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the North Carolina Secretary of State's online portal.</li>
              <li>Create a user account.</li>
              <li>Select "Create a Business" and choose "Limited Liability Company (Domestic)."</li>
              <li>Follow the on-screen prompts, carefully entering the information you prepared.</li>
              <li>Pay the <strong>$125</strong> filing fee with a credit card. You will receive an email confirmation once your LLC is officially approved, typically within a few business days.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 4: Create Your LLC Operating Agreement</h2>
            <p>
              An Operating Agreement is the internal contract that governs your LLC. While North Carolina does not require you to file one, operating without it is a massive mistake.
            </p>

            <p>
              This document proves your LLC is a separate legal entity and dictates:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ownership & Percentages:</strong> Who owns what slice of the company.</li>
              <li><strong>Management Structure:</strong> How decisions are made.</li>
              <li><strong>Profit Distribution:</strong> How and when owners get paid.</li>
              <li><strong>Exit & Contingency Plans:</strong> What happens if a member leaves, dies, or the business closes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Without an Operating Agreement, you are subject to NC's generic state laws, which may not align with your intentions. This document is for your internal records; do not send it to the state.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 5: Get Your Federal EIN for Free</h2>
            <p>
              An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is your business's federal tax ID. You need it to open a business bank account, hire employees, and file taxes. It is non-negotiable for a legitimate business.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How to get it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Apply directly on the <strong>official IRS website</strong>.</li>
              <li>The application is online, takes less than 15 minutes, and is <strong>100% FREE</strong>.</li>
              <li>You will receive your EIN number instantly upon successful completion.</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 my-10">
              <p className="mb-0"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not pay for an EIN. Any site charging a fee is a third-party middleman scamming you for a free government service.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">CRITICAL Next Steps After Your NC LLC is Approved</h2>
            <p>
              Your LLC is formed, but you're not ready for business yet. Complete these steps to stay compliant and protected.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Open a Business Bank Account:</strong> This is the most important step for protecting your personal assets. Use your Articles of Organization and EIN to open a dedicated business checking account. <strong>Never use your personal account for business transactions.</strong> Mixing funds ("commingling") can destroy your liability protection in a lawsuit.</li>
              <li><strong>File Your NC Annual Report:</strong> This is crucial. Every year, your LLC must file an Annual Report with the Secretary of State by <strong>April 15th</strong>. The filing fee is <strong>$200</strong>. Set a calendar reminder now. Failure to file on time will result in your LLC being dissolved by the state.</li>
              <li><strong>Secure Business Licenses & Permits:</strong> Your LLC is a state-level entity. You may still need local licenses or permits from your specific city or county to operate legally. Check your local government's website for requirements based on your industry.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">North Carolina LLC FAQ</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">How long does it take to form an LLC in North Carolina?</h3>
            <p>
              When filing online, you can expect approval in about 3-5 business days, sometimes faster. Mail filing can take weeks.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">What's the most expensive part of a North Carolina LLC?</h3>
            <p>
              The ongoing <strong>$200 Annual Report fee</strong> is the most significant cost. The initial $125 filing fee is a one-time expense, but the annual report is a recurring liability you must budget for.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Can I be my own Registered Agent in North Carolina?</h3>
