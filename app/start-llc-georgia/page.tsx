            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 1: Name Your Georgia LLC (And Not Screw It Up)</h2>
            <p>
              This isn't just about branding; it's about complying with state law.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Georgia's Naming Rules</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>It MUST contain the right suffix:</strong> Your name has to end with "Limited Liability Company," "L.L.C.," or "LLC." Most people just use "LLC."</li>
              <li><strong>It MUST be distinguishable:</strong> Your name cannot be identical or deceptively similar to any other business registered in Georgia. "Atlanta Carpet Cleaning LLC" is too close to "Atlanta Carpet Cleaners, LLC."</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">How to Perform a Georgia LLC Name Search</h3>
            <p>
              Don't guess. Verify your name is available before you do anything else.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the Georgia Corporations Division eCorp portal.</li>
              <li>Click on "Business Search."</li>
              <li>Type your desired LLC name into the "Business Name" field.</li>
              <li>If your search returns "No data found," the name is likely available. If you see a list of similar names, you need to pick something else.</li>
            </ol>

              <p className="mb-0"><strong>Pro Tip: Secure Your Digital Real Estate NOW.</strong> Before you file with the state, check if the matching domain name and social media handles are available. There is nothing worse than forming "Peach State Powerwash LLC" only to find out the domain is taken and the Instagram handle is a meme account. Secure your digital assets <em>before</em> you make the name legally official.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 2: Choose Your Georgia Registered Agent</h2>
            <p>
              Every Georgia LLC is required to have a Registered Agent. This is a non-negotiable legal requirement.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">What is a Registered Agent and Why Do You Need One?</h3>
            <p>
              A Registered Agent is a person or company designated to accept official legal documents (like a lawsuit) and state notices on behalf of your business. They must have a physical street address in Georgia (no P.O. Boxes) and be available during all normal business hours.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 3: File Your Georgia Articles of Organization Online</h2>
            <p>
              This is the legal document that officially creates your LLC. Filing it online is the only way to go.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Information You Need BEFORE You Start</h3>
            <p>
              Have this information ready in a separate document to make the online filing process smooth and fast:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your official, available LLC Name.</li>
              <li>The name and physical Georgia street address of your Registered Agent.</li>
              <li>The full name and address of each "organizer" (the person filing the paperwork, likely you).</li>
              <li>Your LLC's principal mailing address.</li>
              <li>A valid email address for official correspondence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Filing on the Georgia eCorp Portal</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the Georgia eCorp portal.</li>
              <li>Select "Create or Register a Business."</li>
              <li>Choose "I am creating a new domestic business."</li>
              <li>Select "Limited Liability Company" from the dropdown menu.</li>
              <li>Follow the on-screen prompts, carefully entering the information you gathered above.</li>
              <li>Pay the <strong>$100</strong> filing fee with a credit card. You'll receive a confirmation, and your approved documents will be emailed to you within about a week.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 4: Create Your LLC Operating Agreement (Your Internal Rulebook)</h2>
            <p>
              While not legally required to be filed with the state, a well-drafted Operating Agreement is <strong>absolutely critical</strong> for your business. It's the internal document that proves you are operating as a legitimate, separate entity.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Your Operating Agreement should define:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Who the members are and their ownership percentages.</li>
              <li><strong>Management:</strong> How the LLC will be managed (by members or appointed managers).</li>
              <li><strong>Profits & Losses:</strong> How money will be distributed to the owners.</li>
              <li><strong>Contingencies:</strong> What happens if a member wants to leave, dies, or you want to dissolve the business.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Without this agreement, you risk personal liability and are subject to Georgia's default state rules, which might not fit your business.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Step 5: Get Your Federal EIN (It's Free and Non-Negotiable)</h2>
            <p>
              An EIN (Employer Identification Number) is a nine-digit number issued by the IRS. It's your business's social security number. You need one to open a business bank account, hire employees, and file taxes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>How to get it:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go <strong>directly to the IRS website</strong>.</li>
              <li>The application is online, takes about 10 minutes, and is <strong>100% FREE</strong>.</li>
              <li>You will receive your EIN immediately upon completion.</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 my-10">
              <p className="mb-0"><strong>Warning:</strong> Never pay a third-party service to get your EIN for you. They are charging you for a free government form.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">CRITICAL Next Steps After Your Georgia LLC is Approved</h2>
            <p>
              Don't stop here. Your LLC is formed, but you're not done.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Open a Business Bank Account:</strong> This is the most important step to protect your personal liability. Use your Articles of Organization and EIN to open a dedicated checking account for your LLC. <strong>Never mix business and personal funds.</strong> Commingling funds can allow a court to "pierce the corporate veil" and hold you personally liable.</li>
              <li><strong>Handle Georgia Annual Registration:</strong> Mark your calendar. Every year between January 1st and April 1st, you must file your annual registration online and pay the <strong>$50 fee</strong>. Failure to do so can result in your LLC being dissolved by the state.</li>
              <li><strong>Secure Business Licenses & Permits:</strong> Your LLC is a legal entity, but you may need additional licenses from your city or county to operate. Check your local government's website for requirements based on your industry and location.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-16 mb-8">Georgia LLC FAQ: Your Questions Answered</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">Do I need a lawyer to start a Georgia LLC?</h3>
            <p>
              No. For a standard LLC, you can easily follow this guide and file yourself online. You only need a lawyer if you have a complex ownership structure or specific legal concerns.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">What's the difference between an organizer and a member?</h3>
            <p>
              The organizer is just the person who files the initial paperwork. The member is the actual owner of the LLC. In most cases, you will be both.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-4">How do I pay myself from my Georgia LLC?</h3>
            <p>
              As a member, you take an "owner's draw." This is simply transferring money from the LLC's business bank account to your personal bank account. It is not a payroll salary unless you have elected to be taxed as an S-Corporation (a more advanced tax strategy).
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-10 rounded-lg my-16 text-center">
              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-6">Ready to Start Your Georgia LLC?</h3>

                You've done the research. Now, take action. Follow these steps, and you'll have a fully-formed, legally sound Georgia LLC ready to do business.
