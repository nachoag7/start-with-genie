            Both an Operating Agreement and Articles of Organization are important for starting an LLC, but they're not the same thing. One is filed with the state, the other is kept for your internal records. This guide explains what each document is, what it does, and why you might need both.

          <h2>What Is an Operating Agreement?</h2>
          <p>
            An Operating Agreement is like a rulebook for your LLC. It's a written document that explains how your business will work on a day-to-day basis. Think of it as the "how-to" manual for running your LLC.
          </p>
          
          <p>Your Operating Agreement typically includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ownership percentages</strong> - Who owns what part of the business</li>
            <li><strong>Voting rules</strong> - How decisions get made</li>
            <li><strong>Profit distribution</strong> - How money gets split among owners</li>
            <li><strong>Management structure</strong> - Who runs the daily operations</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute resolution</strong> - How to handle disagreements</li>
            <li><strong>What happens if someone leaves</strong> - Rules for when owners change</li>
            <li><strong>Financial rules</strong> - How money is handled and reported</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Are Articles of Organization?</h2>
          <p>
            Articles of Organization is the official paperwork that creates your LLC with the state. It's like the birth certificate for your business. When the state approves this document, your LLC officially exists in the eyes of the law.
          </p>
          
          <p>Your Articles of Organization typically includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>LLC name</strong> - The official name of your business</li>
            <li><strong>Business address</strong> - Where your LLC is located</li>
            <li><strong>Registered agent</strong> - Who receives legal papers for your LLC</li>
            <li><strong>Business purpose</strong> - What your LLC does (usually very general)</li>
            <li><strong>Management structure</strong> - Whether it's member-managed or manager-managed</li>
            <li><strong>Filing date</strong> - When you want your LLC to start</li>
            <li><strong>Organizer information</strong> - Who is filing the paperwork</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why You Need Both</h2>
          <p>
            You need both documents for different reasons. The Articles of Organization make your LLC official with the state - they're what legally creates your business. The Operating Agreement keeps your LLC organized internally - it's what prevents confusion and fights between owners.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Think of it this way: Articles of Organization are like getting a driver's license (the state says you can drive), while the Operating Agreement is like learning the rules of the road (how you actually drive safely). You need both to be successful.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Having both documents helps you avoid legal issues later. If you don't have an Operating Agreement, state law will decide how your LLC works, and that might not be what you want. Plus, banks and other businesses often ask to see your Operating Agreement before working with you.
          </p>

          <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Thinking the Articles replace an Operating Agreement</strong> - They serve different purposes and you need both</li>
            <li><strong>Not customizing your Operating Agreement</strong> - Use a template but make it fit your specific business needs</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting to keep the Operating Agreement updated</strong> - Update it when ownership changes or business grows</li>
            <li><strong>Not having all members sign the Operating Agreement</strong> - Everyone should sign to show they agree to the rules</li>
            <li><strong>Using the same Operating Agreement for different businesses</strong> - Each LLC should have its own customized agreement</li>
            <li><strong>Not understanding what you're signing</strong> - Read and understand both documents before signing</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          
          <h3>Which one should I file first?</h3>
          <p>Articles of Organization, because they legally create your LLC. You can write your Operating Agreement before or after filing, but many people do it after to make sure the LLC is approved first.</p>

          <h3>Do all states require an Operating Agreement?</h3>
          <p>No, but it's still a smart move to have one. Even if your state doesn't require it, having an Operating Agreement protects you and makes your business look more professional to banks and customers.</p>

          <h3>Can I change my Operating Agreement later?</h3>
          <p>Yes, if all members agree. You can update your Operating Agreement anytime by having all owners sign a new version. Keep the old version for your records.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have an Operating Agreement?</h3>
          <p>Your LLC will still exist (if you filed Articles of Organization), but state law will decide how it works. This might not be what you want, and it can cause problems if you have multiple owners or want to sell your business later.</p>

          <h3>Can I use the same documents for multiple LLCs?</h3>
          <p>No. Each LLC needs its own Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement. Even if the businesses are similar, each LLC is a separate legal entity and needs its own paperwork.</p>

          <h3>Do I need a lawyer to create these documents?</h3>
          <p>Not necessarily. Many people use templates or online services. However, if your business is complex, has multiple owners, or involves significant money, consulting with a lawyer is a good idea.</p>
